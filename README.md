**Turn your fan art into earnings — with automatic royalty sharing to the original creator.**

LicenSea is an on-chain licensing marketplace where creators publish works and define their own royalty rules.
Fans can view or purchase access to these works, and they can also create legitimate derivative works inspired by them, which automatically share revenue with the original creator. Assets are stored through Walrus, access is protected by Seal, and all licensing logic runs on Sui Move smart contracts.

Our goal is to make derivative creativity fair and transparent, and to build an ecosystem where fans, creators, and secondary creators can collaborate without conflict.
